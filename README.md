Rule of how to play this card game 

-first : distribute card to user and pc (pc first and user second ) until user and pc each player have 2 card in hand

-second : check the card in pc and user hand , if user or pc got both sum of point each card together equal to 8 or 9 => will win or draw in the game if              another oponent card smaller than them ,Example : if user1 card in hand are 5 and 3 that mean he/she got 8 score so if user2 got under 8 , user2 lost the game , however if user2 got 9 thus winner is user2 . 
Noted :  sum of both card, if more than 10 points , we get only the last digit number Example: 6+5=11 => equal to 1 || 22 equal to 2 || J K and Q each card equal to zero, so if we got 2 cards are J Q and K => equal we get 0 point

-third : if both people card under 8 and 9 , they can decide whether they want to draw a card from the desk or not, and after draw the card , checking winner again , if one of player got sum of 3 card point higher than other => winner is the higher point.
Noted : if 3 cards in hand are J K and Q this 3 cards in hand => win the game against 3 card user , but not 2 cards user with 8 or 9 points .
